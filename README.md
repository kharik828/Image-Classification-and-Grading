# Image-Classification-and-Grading
Many business problems related to image classification and grading remain unsolved due to the extensive effort required for obtaining ground truth data, processing large datasets, and building complex Deep Neural Network (DNN) models. Moreover, even with significant investment in these processes, there is no guarantee of achieving strong model performance.

My aim is to demonstrate how multi-modal LLMs such as Google Gemini can significantly reduce the time and improve the confidence in solving such business problems, compared with building Deep Neural Nets such as CNN using Tensorflow framework.

This repository includes:
1. A PDF detailing architectures for two different AI solutions on the AWS platform:
   1. A CNN model for image classification
   2. A serverless approach using Google Gemini 1.5_pro_002 for image classification and grading 
2. Requirements for both AI solutions
3. Jupyter Notebooks for the development and execution of both approaches
4. AWS Lambda Functions for implementing the serverless approach with LLMs
